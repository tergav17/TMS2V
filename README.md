# TMS2V
This project aims to allow a V9938 VDP to be installed in place of a TMS9918A. Since the V9938 is (largely) backwards compatible with the TMS9918A, existing software for upgraded systems should still function as normal. 
Besides interposing the 40-pin socket that the TMS9918A plugged into, an extra address line may be attacked to the bus to allow for addressing of the addition 2 ports found on the V9938.
